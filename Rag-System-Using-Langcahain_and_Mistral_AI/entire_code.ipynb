These \\nchallenges often lead to frequent conditions of either shorta ges \\nor overstocking of drugs, which adversely affect healthcare \\ndelivery and business profitability. This study addresses this \\nissue through the development of a data -driven system using \\nmachine learning to predict drug sales efficiently and \\naccurately. This work involved gathering sales data from local \\npharmacies, performing some pre -processing steps, and \\nimplementing a time-series forecast using the SARIMA model, \\nwhich works efficiently with seasonal variations in sales data. A \\nlocally hosted, user -friendly web application was developed \\nusing the Flask framework to present these predictions in a \\nreadable format for pharmacists and drug sellers. The system \\nwas also validated on an external dataset, demonstrating high \\naccuracy in the forecasted sales, which helped improve \\ninventory management practices. The proposed system reduces \\ndrug shortages, minimizes wastage due to expiration, and \\nenhances supply chain efficiency, thereby improving healthcare \\ndelivery and business outcomes. This research provides \\nevidence of the opportunity to leverage pharmaceutical sales \\ndata to identify disease trends and inform public health \\nstrategies. The model can be further improved and applied in \\nvarious aspects by including additional variables. This research \\nbridges gaps in su pply chain management, improving the \\navailability of medications and making inventory management \\nmore predictable, benefiting both public health and industry \\nstakeholders. \\nKeywords—drug sales analysis, pharmaceutical sales \\nprediction, public health, SARIMA, time series forecasting \\nI. INTRODUCTION  \\nThe pharmaceutical industry is inherently dynamic; \\nhence, accurate sales forecasting is increasingly crucial for \\npublic health and for responding with appropriate marketing \\nstrategies. The industry in Sri Lanka faces many challenges, \\nincluding seasonal bus iness cycles, varied weather \\nconditions, local epidemics, importation obstacles, exchange \\nrate fluctuations, and economic instability. These factors \\ncontribute to unpredictable demand for drugs, often resulting \\nin drug shortages and oversupply, which negat ively impact \\npublic health outcomes and business viability. Despite the \\ncritical importance of accurate sales predictions, predictive \\nmodeling techniques have been underexplored in the Sri \\nLankan pharmaceutical market. \\n This study addresses these challenges by developing a \\ndata-driven system that leverages advanced machine learning \\nalgorithms to forecast drug sales with high accuracy, \\nparticularly focusing on categorical drugs. The research \\nanalyses historical sales data to identify important patterns and \\ntrends driving drug demand, enabling better decision-making \\nin inventory and supply chain management for sellers and \\npharmacists. A user-friendly web application, built using the \\nFlask framework, visually presents sales forecasts in an \\nunderstandable format for practical implementation of the \\nreal-world problem. The models are subjected to external \\nvalidation with datasets, ensuring their reliability and \\napplicability. This work concludes by bridging the gap \\nbetween data science and pharmaceutical retailing in Sri \\nLanka, enhancing drug availability and reducing wastage to \\nimprove efficiency in the supply chain and, as a result, \\ncontribute to a healthier and more resilient society. \\nII.

DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION METHODOLOGY \\nIn this section, a systematic approach is described for \\ndesigning and implementing the predictive system for \\nmedical drug sales forecasting in particular areas. The \\napproach assures the development of a useful and easy to use \\nsolution, mixing machine learn ing techniques and a web -\\nbased interface to help pharmacists and drug sellers manage \\ninventory.  \\n \\nFollowing diagram outlines the structured process \\nfollowed in th is research, from identifying the problem and \\nobjectives to data collection, analysis, model development, \\nand the final presentation of findings and recommendations. \\n \\nFig. 1.   Research flow diagram \\n \\nThe overall design is modular in nature comprising of the \\ndata collection, data preprocessing, development of the \\nmachine learning model and integration with web \\napplication. The aim is to enable smooth linkage between this \\npredictive model and end users by supplying access through \\na web interface and preserve accuracy and reliability of sales \\nforecast [13] and [15]. \\nA. Data Collection and Preprocessing   \\nThe data of sales was compiled with the help of returned \\nregistered subordinate local pharmacies. One -year data was \\ndeemed a necessary palette to infer seasonal trends and \\nvariations periodically, where the forecasting model is \\nsensitive to those variations [14] and [18].  \\n \\nAgain, the actions that were taken on this data set can be \\nwell understood under the broader umbrella of preprocessing \\nof data. Data pre -processing involved dealing with missing \\nvalues and outliers with a view on achieving clean data [5]. \\nFeature engineeri ng was performed by categorizing the \\ndataset by drug types and including time -dependent factors \\nthat may affect sales, including weekly sales [6]. For finding \\nthe stationarity of the time series data the first integrated \\nstationary test was performed with the help of Augmented \\nDickey–Fuller (ADF) test [5]. Also, the data was divided into \\ntraining and testing data sets in order to feed into a machine \\nlearning model used to predict performances from the \\nobtained information. \\nB. Model Development \\nThe Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average \\n(SARIMA) model was selected for its robustness in handling \\nseasonal patterns and trends in time series data. This made it \\nwell-suited for predicting the sales of medical drugs across \\ndifferent categorie s [8],[3] and [21]. The SARIMA model \\nwas trained on historical sales data for each drug category, \\nwith parameters optimized to minimize prediction error \\nduring training. The model outputs weekly sales forecasts, \\nincluding confidence intervals that indicate  the reliability of \\nthe predictions [21].  \\nC. Web Application Development \\nEssential to the current design, Flask was used to connect \\nthe backend predictive model to the frontend look and feel. \\nThis allowed for a proper linkage between the actual \\nmachine learning model and the final web application, \\nthereby allowing the predictions of the model to be passed \\non to the user in real time with an easy to use web interface \\n[7] and [12].   \\n      1)Frontend Development: This web site has been \\nimplemented using HTML and CSS to present a flawless, \\nconsistent and user-friendly interface. C B devices were \\nstandard dialog boxes which were used for selection of drug \\ncategory and prediction date and results of drug prices were \\ngiven numerically and in graphical form for better \\ninteraction and for better understanding of results [10] and \\n[12].   \\n      2)Backend Development: Most importantly Python was \\nvery useful in handling of back end of logic to interconnect \\nthe web base interface and the machine learnt model. By \\nemploying Flask’s Render Template, HTML page inputs \\nwere entered by the user and directly translated to page \\ngeneration, eliminating complications inherent in the \\ninteraction process and offering a smooth user interface [7] \\nand [19]. \\nD. User Interface Design \\nSimplicity and functionality in design made user interface \\n(UI) design for a usable user interface for users, which \\ninclude pharmacists and drug sellers. Usability, readability \\nand navigation were key design elements implemented.  \\n1)Pages: The web application includes four primary \\npages to facilitate user interaction. Navigation is from input \\nto results and/or from results to about and from start page as \\nthe entry point. The Input Page has a form based interface \\nwhere we can select which mature drug category to predict \\nand what date to predict. The output on the Results Page \\nshows the predicted sales values, the confidence intervals \\nand an comparative line graph between the historical and \\nforecasted data. And the About page provides the details of \\nthe why, what, who, and how of the application and the \\ndevelopment team behind this project [15] and [16].  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIdentifyresearchproblem\\nandobjectives\\nReviewliteratureandpast\\nstudies\\nPlanresearchmethodology\\nand tools\\nDatacollectionand\\npreprocessing\\nDataanalysisandmodel\\nselection\\nModeldevelopment\\nImplementfrontendand\\nbackend andwebapp\\noptimising\\nFindings discussion\\nResearchrecommendations\\nandconclusion'),\n",

Users can choose a specific \\ndate for the sales forecast with the Date Picker and easily \\nselect drug categories in the Dropdown Menus grouped under \\nits related classifications. Desired results page was crafted to \\ndeliver the forecasts. Using Line Graphs, we can see predict \\nsales trends against historical data so that our viewers can \\nunderstand the data in clear and easy ways. Graphs show \\nlabels, legends, different colors s eparately for historical and \\npredicted data points for comparing. Furthermore, Dynamic \\nVisualization updates in real time based on user input \\nproviding immediate feedback [9].   \\n \\n3)Visualization: Key principles for an optimal user \\nexperience guide the design. To create a look that's \\nprofessional but easy to understand, a medical themed, high \\ncontrast, low demand interface was chosen. Readability: \\nBeing white text on dark background, with the typograph y \\nmaking it really clear and legible to read. Responsiveness: It’s \\nfully compatible with desktops, tablets and mobile phones, so \\na user experience across platforms is no issue [12][19].   \\n \\n4)Consistency and Aesthetics: The design adheres to the \\nfollowing principles  \\n• Color Scheme: a medical-themed, high contrast, \\nlow demand, low resource interface with \\nelements that promote a professional and easy to \\nunderstand interface.  \\n \\n• Readability: White text on dark backgrounds for \\neasy reading, a clear and legible typography. \\nResponsiveness: Compatible with all devices, \\ndesktops, tablets and mobile phones [12]. \\n \\n     5)Accessibility Features: The design is designed for ease \\nof use and caters for a wide range of users, from members \\nwith no technical experience at all. It styles buttons and links \\nwith hover effect hover effects and tooltips for guidance. \\nNavigation is intuitive, and users can litera lly switch from \\none page to another, and if it’s not clear already, there is a \\nworkflow and users who lack tech skills still got access \\n[20][19].  \\n \\n      6)Implementation Workflow: Python was used to develop \\nthe backend of the application. It uses libraries from NumPy \\nand Pandas to clean the data in the most efficient way \\npossible. We also used these libraries to clean and structure \\ndata and handle large datasets [6][18]. After analyzing \\nforecasting capabilities via scikit -learn, an algorithm was \\nchosen to induce SARIMA model which can handle seasonal \\npatterns and trends and can generate accurate and reliable \\nforecasts [8][3]. Robust error handling and  data validation \\nwas added for maintaining the predictions’ quality, as well as \\nfor the backend.  \\n       This was created making use of HTML and CSS, to give \\nan appealing, wearable, and responsive structure. A \\nconsistent user experience across devices, from desktop to \\nmobile phone, was taken care of. Interactive elements were \\nintroduced to increase the  visibility and provide real time \\nunderstanding to users. These features keep users in place, no \\nmatter the expertise in terms of the app.   \\n       Flask served as a lightweight Python web framework \\nwith the integration implemented between the front end and \\nback end. It bridged real time communication between the \\nprediction engine and the user interface. The backend \\nprocessed user inputs (e.g. selected drug categories, and \\ndates) and returned required predictions to the frontend in a \\nuser friendly way. This integration made the system both \\nfunctional and user friendly, it became a great experience for \\nmouth to mouth sales for pharmacists and for  drug sellers \\n[19][7].  \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSales Prediction\\nCategory\\nM01AB\\nM01AB\\nStarting Date\\nD/YYYY):\\nM01AE\\n02/02/2024\\n画\\nN02BA\\nN02BE\\nReset\\nN05B\\nSubmit\\nN05C\\nR03\\nR06\\nMedical Drug Sales\\nPrediction\\nStart\\nAbout\\nPrediction ResultforM01ABSales\\nStartingDate:2024-02-02\\nClosest validprediction date:2024-02-04\\nForecastvalue:34.6\\nForecast forM01ABuntil 2024-02-02\\nC1\\nforecasted_MolAs\\n60\\nPredicted Value\\n1Vaiye\\n20\\nDate\"),\n",

And visualize the historical sales and \\nforecasted sales up until the input date by a plot. For this \\nwhole project we went through several processes. \\n \\n      1)Find a data set: We spend more time to find an actual \\ndata set. As a result of it We finally found an actual pharmacy \\ndata set. So, this leads us to a real -world application. Data \\npre-processing at this point we had to do remake the data set \\naccording to our project. We h ad to categorize data under \\neight categories, handle missing values and remove outliers. \\nWe got a structured data set which allows for meaningful \\nforecasting. Then we did a stationarity check, we used the \\nAugmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to check stationarity in \\nthe sales data.  \\n \\n      In our case it was non-stationary because we found that  \\np-value is 1. Then we used differencing to make it stationary \\nbecause stationarity is crucial for time series models like \\nSARIMA.          \\n \\n      2)Model selection and fitting : We chose Seasonal \\nAutoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) \\nmodel with the parameters that we got through the previous \\ntests.  The SARIMA model was fit to the historical sales data \\nfor each medical drug category. The fitting process involved \\noptimizing parameters to minimize prediction error. Our \\nmodel forecasts future sales for a particular category weekly, \\nincluding point forecasts (predicted mean). Finally, we \\ncreated an accurate model.  \\n \\n      3)Frontend development:  We created a user interface \\nwhich is a user-friendly and attractive web front end for our \\nproject using HTML, CSS. The user should give the category \\nand date, then the prediction value and a user -friendly plot \\nshows in UI as the output.  \\n \\n      4)Backend development: Python flask API is the backend \\nof our project which handles the communication between \\nfront end and the prediction model successfully. \\n      5)Significance of this study:  This study plays a crucial \\nrole in improving pharmaceutical sales forecasting, \\nparticularly in Sri Lanka, where such applications remain \\nunderexplored. By leveraging the SARIMA model, the \\nresearch enhances accuracy in predicting drug demand, \\nhelping to minimize shortages and overstocking.   \\n \\n      The integration of machine learning with inventory \\nmanagement optimizes supply chain efficiency, reducing \\ncosts and ensuring better availability of essential \\nmedications. This contributes to the advancement of AI -\\ndriven decision-making in healthcare logistics.   \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDrug sales predictor\\nEnter Category\\nProcess Data\\n<<include>>\\nGenerate Predictions and Graph\\nUser Input\\n<<include>>\\nUser\\nDisplay Results\\nSystem\\nEnter Date\\nUser\\nSystem\\n input data\\nEnter Data\\nSelect Drug Category\\nInputs are provided\\nProcess data\\nGenerate prediction and graph\\nDisplay result\\nActity Diagram\"),\n",

And our model built up as a weekly prediction \\nmodel. As a result, we can see the mean prediction value for \\nthe week that your input date in. We build up this model by \\ntargeting a pharmacy. So, user can decide the number of \\ndrugs for each category that they need for a date or a week, \\ntherefore the pharmacy can identify most needed medical \\ndrugs for a particular time for their area. Because of that they \\nget a higher profit from reducing the drug shortage and drug \\nwastage. \\n \\n      In the other hand patients can buy medicines when they \\nneed it, this helps to make a healthiness society.

DISCUSSION  \\n      In this project Our aim is to create a locally host website \\nfor a pharmacy of an area to predict medical drug sales in that \\narea for categorical drugs. Through this project we basically \\ngive the output as predicted sales for a chosen drug category \\nfor a given date. And visualize the historical sales and \\nforecasted sales up until the input date by a plot. For this \\nwhole project we went through several processes. \\n \\n      1)Find a data set: We spend more time to find an actual \\ndata set. As a result of it We finally found an actual pharmacy\")]\n",

      "A drug is a chemical substance used for medical or therapeutic purposes. It can be defined as a molecule or a group of molecules that have a specific pharmacological effect on the human body. Drugs can be classified into different categories based on their mode of action, route of administration, or therapeutic indication. Examples of drug categories include opioids, antidepressants, antivirals, and antibiotics. Drugs can be administered through various routes, such as oral, intravenous, topical, or inhalation. The pharmaceutical industry is responsible for the development, testing, and marketing of drugs, and it plays a crucial role in improving human health and well-being.\n"
